# Age-Estimation-DL

This project implements an age estimation model that predicts the age of a person based on image data (e.g., facial features). We use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image processing and regression techniques for the final age prediction. The model has been tested on various datasets and provides accurate results.

# Features
Predicts the age of individuals from images.
Implements a deep learning model using CNN.
Pretrained models for quicker deployment.
High accuracy on benchmark datasets.

# Installation
# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on model choice)
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
